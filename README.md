# "Prevent Duplicate Tabs" Chrome extension

Chrome extension that detects when a duplicate tab is opened and activates already existing tab.

## How to install

I have not published this extension into Chrome Web Store, so your will need to install extension locally:

1. Clone extension to your machine - e.g. `git clone https://github.com/Litee/prevent-duplicate-tabs-chrome-extension.git`
1. Look at `background.js` and into `manifest.json`. It is always a good idea to check that code does not do anything suspicious and does not have too many permissions ;)
1. Open chrome://extensions tab in your Chrome browser
1. Activate developer mode (required for next step)
1. Install extension as unpacked

Ping me if you liked this extension and I may consider publishing it into Chrome Web Store.
